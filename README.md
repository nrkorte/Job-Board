# Job-Board

This is the main repository for *The Stable*, a job board website that streamlines all things related to applying to jobs. This site backs up all information on a CV to a secure SQLITE database and return it on any job application, turning the redundancy of re-inputting CV information into a thing of the past.

All security-related files are hidden for discretion. My databases use the most up-date encryption standards to secure user information at the highest standards.

This is a work in progress and more information about the site will be provided as it develops.
